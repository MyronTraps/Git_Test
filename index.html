            Just some ordinary words for this ordinary website
        </p>
        <p>Here is a little list:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The universe that we live in</li>
            <li>Is random and meaningless</li>
            <li>The fundamental concept of nature</li>
            <li>Is that every living being survives by killing and eating other living beings</li>
            <li>only to eventually be eaten itself</li>
            <li>But not before living a life filled with suffering and misery</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>We have allowed oil and gas companies to propagandize about the danger of global warming</li>
            <li>Exactly the same way tobacco companies did regarding the dangers of smoking</li>
            <li>The same sociopolitical structure that allows corporations to get away with shit like this</li>
            <li>Also resists any change to itself, making the task of effective climate change action all but impossible </li>
            <li>And the only people powerful enough to help are those who personally profit from this state of affairs</li>
            <li>And do everything they can to prevent the masses from making the necessary changes, or from even acknowledging that a problem exists in the first place</li>
            <li>But that doesn't mean we should do nothing, as every mass movement begins on the individual level</li>
